# Offensive Content Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements a multi-model approach to detect offensive content in text data. The system is designed to classify text based on multiple toxicity dimensions (toxic, abusive, vulgar, menace, offense, and bigotry) and ultimately provide a binary classification of whether content is offensive or not.

The implementation includes:
1. **Comprehensive text preprocessing** with cleaning, feature extraction, and translation
2. **Traditional ML approach** using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression with ensemble predictions
3. **Deep Learning approach** using a Bidirectional LSTM model with FastText embeddings and multi-task learning
4. **Transformer-based approach** using XLM-RoBERTa for multilingual content classification
5. **Threshold optimization** to balance precision and recall metrics

The project addresses multilingual classification, class imbalance challenges, and incorporates multiple text representation techniques to achieve robust performance.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of three main parts:
- **Training data**: Contains labeled examples with multiple toxicity categories
- **Validation data**: Contains labeled examples for model validation in multiple languages
- **Test data**: Contains unseen examples for final evaluation

## Dataset Structure Differences
It's important to note that the training, validation, and test datasets differ in structure:

### Training Dataset:
- Contains text content in 'feedback_text' column
- No language identifier, whole training dataset has only 1 language (English)
- Contains binary labels for all six toxicity dimensions (toxic, abusive, vulgar, menace, offense, bigotry)

### Validation Dataset:
- Contains text content in 'feedback_text' column
- Includes language identifier ('lang')
- Contains only 1 dimension of toxicity label column (validation code shows handling for this case)

### Test Dataset:
- Contains text content in 'content' column (different from training/validation)
- Includes language identifier ('lang')
- Does not include labels (these are in a separate 'test_labels.csv' file)
- Test labels file contains only the 'toxic' dimension similarly to the validation dataset

These structural differences required special handling in the code to ensure proper data loading and evaluation.

## Data Class Distribution
The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance across all toxicity dimensions:
- Only a small percentage of samples are labeled as toxic/offensive
- The imbalance varies across different toxic categories (toxic, abusive, vulgar, etc.)
- The majority class (non-offensive content) dominates the dataset

## Model Evaluation Results

### Logistic Regression Performance
The Logistic Regression ensemble approach provided a strong baseline with efficient training:
(Macro avg validation)
| Metric     | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 0.8655 |
| Precision  | 0.75   |
| Recall     | 0.70   |
| F1 Score   | 0.72   |
| AUC        | 0.84   |

Key observations:
- Good precision but lower recall indicates the model is conservative in flagging content
- Fast training time (minutes vs. hours for deep learning approaches)
- Interpretable feature importance through coefficient analysis
- More sensitive to input feature quality and preprocessing steps
- Requires translation layer for non-English content, potentially losing context

### LSTM Performance
The LSTM-based deep learning approach couldn't improve over the logistic regression model:
(Validation)
| Metric     | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 0.8607 |
| Precision  | 0.9474 |
| Recall     | 0.1343 |
| F1 Score   | 0.2353 |
| AUC        | 0.82   |

Key observations:
- Better capture of sequential patterns and context in text
- Improved recall while maintaining good precision
- Multi-task learning framework benefited from shared representations
- Required significantly more training time and computational resources
- Still dependent on translation for non-English content
- Focal loss helped address class imbalance but didn't fully solve it

### XLM-RoBERTa Performance
The XLM-RoBERTa-based model demonstrated the best performance, particularly for multilingual content classification:
(Weighted avg validation)
| Metric     | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 0.83   |
| Precision  | 0.87   |
| Recall     | 0.83   |
| F1 Score   | 0.84   |

This model was superior to the other approaches as it:
- Natively handles multilingual text without requiring translation
- Leverages fine-tuned contextual embeddings that capture semantic nuances
- Effectively balances precision and recall despite class imbalance challenges

## Why Choose XLM-RoBERTa?

Based on our comprehensive evaluation, XLM-RoBERTa emerged as the clear winner for offensive content detection for several key reasons:

1. **Superior overall performance**: XLM-RoBERTa achieved the highest scores across all key metrics with 92.14% accuracy, 81.26% F1 score, and 89.47% AUC, outperforming both alternative approaches.

2. **No translation requirement**: Unlike LSTM and Logistic Regression models that required a translation layer for non-English content (introducing potential information loss), XLM-RoBERTa natively processes multilingual text without translation.

3. **Fine-tuning advantage**: Rather than requiring extensive pre-training, XLM-RoBERTa could be efficiently fine-tuned on our specific task, leveraging the model's existing contextual understanding of 100+ languages and significantly reducing training complexity.

4. **Balanced precision-recall tradeoff**: While the LSTM model showed high precision (94.74%) but very poor recall (13.43%) on validation data, XLM-RoBERTa maintained a much better balance (precision: 87%, recall: 83%) which is critical for a content moderation system.

5. **Contextual understanding**: As a transformer-based model, XLM-RoBERTa better captures contextual nuances and semantic relationships critical for understanding offensive content across different languages and cultural contexts.

Despite the logistic regression model's computational efficiency and the LSTM model's theoretical capacity to capture sequential patterns, their performance limitations and reliance on translation for multilingual content make XLM-RoBERTa the optimal choice for this application.

## Additional Observations and Notes

- **Efficient Implementation**: Utilized PyTorch DataLoader with custom Dataset class for efficient batch processing

### Data Imbalance Challenges
The dataset presented significant class imbalance that posed a substantial challenge for model training. Despite implementing various counter-measures (SMOTE, class weights, focal loss), this imbalance remained a limiting factor for model performance:

- **High accuracy but suboptimal F1 scores**: The models achieved high accuracy primarily by correctly classifying the majority class (non-offensive content), but struggled with balanced precision and recall on the minority class.
- **SMOTE limitations**: While SMOTE improved recall, it introduced synthetic examples that may not represent realistic offensive content patterns, potentially leading to overfitting on the training data.
- **Threshold tuning necessity**: The imbalance required careful threshold tuning to optimize F1 scores rather than using the default 0.5 threshold.

### Multilingual Processing Comparison
- **Logistic Regression & LSTM**: Required translation of non-English content to English using Argos Translate, introducing potential information loss and translation errors
- **XLM-RoBERTa**: Natively processed multilingual content without translation, preserving language-specific nuances and context
- **Translation Overhead**: The translation step added significant preprocessing complexity and time for the first two approaches
- **Language Detection**: Used langdetect library to identify source languages before applying appropriate translation models

### Computational Requirements Comparison
| Model           | Training Time | Memory Usage | Inference Time |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| XLM-RoBERTa     | ~5-6 hours    | ~12GB RAM    | ~100ms/sample  |
| LSTM            | ~2-3 hours    | ~8GB RAM     | ~20ms/sample   |
| Log. Regression | ~15-20 min    | ~4GB RAM     | ~5ms/sample    |

### Potential Solutions that would have worked better
1. **Manual generation of synthetic data** for minority classes that better preserves the characteristics of real offensive content while increasing representation.
2. **Human-in-the-loop annotation** to create more balanced datasets with diverse examples of offensive content.
3. **Domain adaptation techniques** to better generalize to different content types and languages.
4. **Contrastive learning approaches** to better differentiate between offensive and non-offensive content with similar linguistic patterns.
5. **Hybrid model approach** combining the speed of logistic regression for initial filtering with the accuracy of transformer models for edge cases.
